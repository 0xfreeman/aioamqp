aioamqp
=======


``aioamqp`` library is a pure-Python implementation of the [AMQP 0.9.1 protocol](https://www.rabbitmq.com/amqp-0-9-1-quickref.html).

Built on top on Python's asynchronous I/O support introduced in [PEP 3156](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3156/), it provides an API based on coroutines, making it easy to write highly concurrent applications.

Bug reports, patches and suggestions welcome! Just open an [issue](https://github.com/Polyconseil/aioamqp/issues/new) or send a [pull request](https://github.com/Polyconseil/aioamqp/compare/).
